Make LaTeX
==========

This is an attempt at a makefile for building LaTeX projects. This is still a work in progress,
but it should be usable for simple projects.

Todo
----

 * Work with multiple files combined with `include`/`input`.
 * Make bibliograpies optional.
 * Add support for indexes & other stuff that requires multiple build runs.
